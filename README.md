# Decentralized Smart News Service

## Project Overview

The Decentralized Smart News Service is an open-source project aimed at aggregating, processing, and distributing news content using decentralized technologies. By leveraging web scraping, AI for content processing, IPFS for storage, and libp2p for distribution, this service aims to provide a scalable, resilient, and user-friendly platform for accessing news.

## Features

- **Web Scraping Module**: Aggregates news content from various sources.
- **AI Processing Module**: Summarizes and categorizes news articles using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Utilizes IPFS for storing processed news content.
- **Peer-to-Peer Distribution**: Employs libp2p for efficient content discovery and distribution.
- **User Interface**: Offers an easy-to-use interface for accessing news content.
